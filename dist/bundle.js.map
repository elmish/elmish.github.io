[Fable](http://fable.io/) which allow you to write your code using F# and compile in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIt is implemented around a set of abstractions which makes it possible to implement custom renderers if there is a need.\r\nFable-arch comes with a HTML Dsl and a renderer built on top of [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) and all\r\nthe samples here are using those two tools.\r\nHopefully the samples here show you how to get started and gives you some inspiration about how to build your application using Fable-arch.\r\n\r\nYou can also contribute more examples by
